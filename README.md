Kore - The Embedded Distributed Log Datastore
=============================================

Looking for a simple embedded
database to store and manage your
data across multiple devices?
**Kore** is the solution you need.

First we had
[Lambda](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lambda_architecture).
Then we had [Kappa](http://milinda.pathirage.org/kappa-architecture.com/)...

Now we have **KORE**!

**Kore** - The Embedded Distributed Log Datastore

## Is Kore for me?

**Kore** is ideal for you if you
have an app with users on multiple
devices (say phone, pad, and
desktop) and need a simple storage
solution without needing to learn
a query language or do any complicated
object-relational mappings.

**Kore** is embedded so deployment is
much simpler - no need to install
and manage a separate database
server.

**Kore** handles disconnections
(on your commute - or on your yatch!)
automatically. It will synchronize
with any upstream nodes correctly,
handling all the complicated edge
cases of managing distributed
data. Users never need to worry
about not being able to "reach
the server".

**Kore** allows you to quickly
and easily set up your initial data,
improve your handling of it
iteratively, and handle cross device
synchronization with near-realtime
updates.

## Is Kore NOT for me?

**Kore** is not for you if you need
a database with a heavy load
(thousands of requests a minute), or
you need the database to do a lot of
processing/complex queries.

Otherwise **Kore** is an excellent
option you could keep in your
toolbox. It's the 'lighter sqllite'
you have been looking for  :-D
